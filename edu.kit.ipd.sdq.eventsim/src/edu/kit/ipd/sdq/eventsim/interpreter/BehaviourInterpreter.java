/**
 * This abstract class is the central facility to traverse the actions of a {@link UsageScenario} or
 * a {@link ResourceDemandingSEFF} (RD-SEFF). Traversing means to start with an initial action,
 * perform the simulation logic associated with this action, and then start over with the next
 * action and so on.
 * <p>
 * For each type of action contained in a behaviour description, a traversal strategy (
 * {@link ITraversalStrategy}) has to be implemented. This strategy does two things: 1) It performs
 * the simulation of the action, i.e. changes the simulation state according to the action under
 * traversal. In other words, the simulation logic associated with this action is executed. 2) It
 * provides the information which action is the next to be traversed. For further information see
 * {@link ITraversalInstruction}. Implementors of this class have to provide appropriate traversal
 * strategies for the various action types by implementing the
 * {@link #loadTraversalStrategy(EClass)} method.
 * <p>
 * It is an inherent property of event based simulations that the behaviour of a simulated entity is
 * distributed over several events. Therefore, the traversal can be paused and scheduled to be
 * resumed after a certain delay. To begin a traversal, use the {@link #beginTraversal()} method. In
 * order to resume a paused traversal, use the {@link #resumeTraversal()} method. The resume method
 * can be called on a fresh instance, which is possible due passing a {@link TraversalState}. The
 * traversal state carries the whole status of the traversal, i.e. which action is the next, which
 * one has just been traversed and so on.
 * <p>
 * Clients can register themselves to receive traversal events. Events are fired whenever an action
 * is about to be traversed and when the traversal of an action has been completed. See
 * {@link ITraversalListener}.
