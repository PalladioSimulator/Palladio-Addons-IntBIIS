 * This listener observes a {@link SimPassiveResource}. It is being notified whenever a
 * {@link SimulatedProcess} requests an arbitrary number of instances of the observed resource, when
 * instances are granted to the requesting process (i.e., the process "acquires" the resource), or
 * when the process releases instances of the resource.
 * <p>
 * Thus, the methods of this listener are invoked in a fixed order as follows.
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@code request}
 * <li>{@code acquire}
 * <li>{@code release}
