# Palladio-Addons-IntBIIS
The approach Integrated Business IT Impact Simulation (IntBIIS) proposes a holistic simulation that combines performance prediction on software architecture level and business process level. It predicts the impact of a business process on the quality of an information system and vice versa at design time. 

Please note that the simulation based on EventSim is not operational yet. The build and update site only considers the modeling extension for Palladio.
