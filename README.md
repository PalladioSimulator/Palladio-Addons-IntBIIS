# IntBIIS

This is a migration project. Until the first release here on GitHub, there will be no posibility to run an IntBIIS simulation.  
IntBIIS is an extension of [EventSim](https://github.com/PalladioSimulator/Palladio-Analyzer-EventSim)

A documentation for [IntBIIS](https://sdqweb.ipd.kit.edu/wiki/IntBIIS) and [EventSim](https://sdqweb.ipd.kit.edu/wiki/EventSim) can be found at the public [SDQ](https://sdq.ipd.kit.edu) wiki. SDQ is the chair Software Design and Quality of the Institute for Program Structures and Data Organization ([IPD](https://www.informatik.kit.edu/english/257.php)). The IPD is part of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology ([KIT](https://www.kit.edu)).
