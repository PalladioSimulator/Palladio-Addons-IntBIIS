# IntBIIS

This is a migration project. Until the first release here on GitHub, there will be no posibility to run an IntBIIS simulation.  
IntBIIS is an extension of [EventSim](https://github.com/PalladioSimulator/Palladio-Analyzer-EventSim)

A documentation for [IntBIIS](https://sdqweb.ipd.kit.edu/wiki/IntBIIS) and [EventSim](https://sdqweb.ipd.kit.edu/wiki/EventSim) can be found at the public wiki of the [Software Design and Quality Chair](https://sdq.ipd.kit.edu) of the [Institute for Program Structures and Data Organization](https://www.informatik.kit.edu/english/257.php)
